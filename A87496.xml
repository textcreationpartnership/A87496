            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The occasion of it is taken primarily from <hi>Ninivehs</hi> horrible &amp; crying transgressions, for <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh</hi> was, <hi>Urbs tam plena vitiis qu√†m divitiis,</hi> a Citie as sinfull as rich: secondly, from the due consideration of the severe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of Gods awfull judgements against her for her trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions: thirdly, from the Commission of <hi>Jonah,</hi> c. 1. v. 2. <hi>Arise, goe to Niniveh, cry against it,</hi> as an Embassadour extraordinary to give drowsie <hi>Niniveh,</hi> out of her profound sleep of sin, an <hi>alarum, to awake unto righteousnesse,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. to shake off stupiditie, senselesnesse, and securitie: for be cryed our, <hi>Adhuc quadraginta,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet fortie dayes, and Niniveh shall be destroyed,</hi> chap. 3. v. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, The Sonne of Truth, and therefore must be beleeved. And in the fifth verse see the effect he wrought; <hi>For the people of Niniveh beleeved God, and proclaimed a Fast, and put on sack-cloth, from the greatest of them to the least,</hi> yea, the King himselfe: for in the verse before my Text, <hi>word came unto him, and he arese from his Throne, and he layd his Robe from him, and covered him with sack-cloth, and sat in ashes.</hi> You see the example: not the Royall. Throne exempts the King from this dutie; the voice of Humiliation calls unto him, not unlike that in <hi>Jere.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Say unto the King and Queen, Humble your selves, sit downe, for your Principalities shall come downe, even the Crowne of your glory.</hi> No mervaile if he be troubled at this voice, as <hi>Herod</hi> was, and all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with him, at the Birth of our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 2.8. No wonder if his knees smite together, as <hi>Belshazzars</hi> did at the hand-writing against him on the wall.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:160342:4"/>
            <p> The use you shall make from hence is, <hi>Learne to heare &amp; give eare, and be not proud, learne to feare him who ought to be feared, who is great amongst the Gods; when he denounceth wrath, when his judgements are abroad, learne righteousnesse, O inhabitants of the earth.</hi> Learne to heate, and feare, and tremble, and to do no more so wickedly; give glory unto God by confession of sinnes, <hi>before your feet stumble upon the darke Mountaines, and while you look for light he turne it into the shadow of death, &amp; make it grosse darkensse,</hi> 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15, 16. Learne to believe &amp; make use of Gods awfull threatned judgements, as well as his gracious promises; I know our corrupt natures are more inclinable to hearken to the latter then the former, for we delight in them; they are a pleasant cordiall, but the other are bitter, though wholsome, pills to swallow downe: but Oh, let faith be set on worke on both subjects: Let the legall denuntiations be received and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as well as the Evangelicall promises: doth God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce judgements? He delighteth in the soule that trembles at his words: does he call for humiliation? <hi>he takes pleasure in the soule that walkes humbly with his God.</hi> And this is the duty and <hi>Practice of Piety</hi> here in my Text: <hi>For the King caused it to let Proclaimed thorow</hi> Niniveh, <hi>and published by the Decree of him and his Nobles, saying, Let neither man nor heast, Herd nor Flock, tast any thing</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but let man and beast be covered with Sack-cloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turne every one from his evill way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</hi> In the composition of which words, there are principally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable three ingredients.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Solemne and strict Humiliation; <hi>Let man</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>2. Solemne and devout Supplication; <hi>Cry mightily</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>3. Vuniversall and reall Reformation; <hi>Every one turne</hi> &amp;c.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Of these in their order. For the first, it is apparent, here is fasting and mourning not onely enjoyned, but joyned together, suitable unto that in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Turne you even to me, with fasting, weeping, and mourning:</hi> For want of this duty, God not onely discountenanceth the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
<pb facs="tcp:160342:4"/>
               <hi>Jewes,</hi> but also reproved them, <hi>Isay</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. when he faith, <hi>The Lord did call to weeping and mourning, and baldnesse, and girding with sack-cloth, but behold joy and gladnesse, slaying of Oxen, and killing of Sheepe, eating flesh and drinking wine; let us eat and drinke, for to morrow we shall die,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>surely this iniquitie shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Sack-cloth it selfe, a rigid garment, is here call'd for also in my Text, as an expressive embleme and symptome of inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and heartie sorrow. It was, it seemes, the usuall and ceremoniall habit of mourners in those times under the Law; they made themselves bald, they sat in ashes, or put ashes on their heads in the Easterne Countries, and they rent their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but we under the Gospel are more spirituall, we presse not the outward adumbration or shadow, so much as the inward substance and materialitie: To us the word is, <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turne to the Lord your God.</hi> I see, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, no garments torne this day, nay, rather with griefe of heart I see apparell in men and women more gorgeous then befits the dust and ashes of this sack-cloth-humbling solemnitie: Oh, that the hidden man of the heart were gay also: Oh, that by a godly and sincere Reformation every one of you would demonstrate, that you strive to adorn the Gospel of our blessed Saviour more then your selves. Sack-cloth, and fasting and mourning, though not meritorious, you see are not disallowed, are not disannulled: nay, the beasts themselves ought nor to goe scot-free, but partake with the people in the outward duties of fasting, &amp;c. I mean, such kind of humiliation as they were capable of. These sensible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, here in my Text, extended even unto them; the rather, that man, who is endued both with a sensitive &amp; reasonable facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, may perceive the odiousnesse &amp; heinousnesse of his prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with his God, which drawes not only o<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> himselfe, but on the beast also such evident humiliation. <hi>A good man is mercifull to his beast,</hi> saith the wisest of Kings: though the wicked (as <hi>Jon<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¶</desc>
               </gap>e thinke, they ought not to be so rigorously unjust, as to pull away pitie from
<pb facs="tcp:160342:5"/>the unreasonable creature, and forfeit clemencie due to beasts. Oh, that our compassion to them, as well as to our selves, could make us consider what we have done! By what hath bin delivered (Beloved) you may perceive how punctuall the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> the Pen-man of the Scriptures, is in this Doctrine of Humiliation; <hi>in fasting, in weeping, and mourning,</hi> it becommeth the godly to be humble; and truly it hath ever bin their constant practice in all Ages: for this, turne to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. <hi>When the Ark of God abode in Kiriathiearim twentie yeares, all the house of Israel lamented af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord, and they turned unto the Lord with all their hearts, and put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the Lord only,</hi> v. 3. <hi>And they drew water, and fasted on that day,</hi> v. 4. And in the Booke of <hi>Judges,</hi> after the people had grievously sinned, and the Angel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them at <hi>Bochim,</hi> in the second chapter, and 4. and 5. verses, it is set downe punctually that they wept: <hi>For it came to passe, when the Angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lift up their voice and wept, and they called the name of that place Bochim.</hi> The good King <hi>Josiah,</hi> when he caused the Law to be read before him (at the hearing whereof his heart melted) appointed a <hi>solemne Fast</hi> to be kept. In the Booke of <hi>Esther, Mardochai</hi> and <hi>Esther,</hi> and her Maidens, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in fasting, and supplication, and sack-cloth, three whole dayes together, to turne away the wrath of God, and defeat the cruell Conspiracie of <hi>Haman,</hi> who had plotted the Nationall destruction of all the <hi>Jewes. Nehemiah,</hi> when he began the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, layd the foundation with a <hi>solemne Fast. Ezra</hi> sanctified the people, at the reading of the Law, with the like humiliation.</p>
            <p>And here I may take occasion (for promoting this dutie) not onely to lay open the nature of this humbling, but the necessitie of it also. The necessitie is drawne from a three-fold reason: the first reason is, because God Almightie often calls for this dutie, as you may reade <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.12. and in divers other places, too long to rehearse: for as there is a voice in every sinne to call for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so there is a voice in every judgment calling for repentance
<pb facs="tcp:160342:5"/>and Humiliation, see for this in <hi>Micah</hi> 6 Chap. 8.9. <hi>He hath shewed thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God? the Lords voyce cryeth unto the Citie, and the</hi> Man <hi>of Wisdome shall see thy name: heare</hi> ye <hi>the Rod, and who hath appoynted it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God willeth us to walke humbly and hear the rod of his controversie. God strikes upon the stony Rocke of our hearts by his judgements and mercies, as with <hi>Moses</hi> his rod, that the Waters of Repentant tears many gush forth; and in the 8 of <hi>Deut.</hi> when God musters up the forces of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the people, and makes an inventory of them, is comes all to this Issue, <hi>That he might humble thee</hi> (O Jsrael) <hi>and prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end.</hi> Deut. 8.16.</p>
            <p>The second reason that necessitates this duty is, because Humiliation onely hath the promise of a blessing annext unto it; St. <hi>Peter</hi> admonisheth us, <hi>Humble your Selves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in his due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose also belongs that memorable place in 26 <hi>of</hi> Levit. <hi>verse</hi> 40 <hi>and</hi> 44. <hi>If they shall confesse their iniquitie and the iniquitie of their Fathers, with their trespasse which they have trespassed against mee, and that also they have walked contrary unto mee</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If then their uncircumcised hearts bee humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquitie: Then will I remember my Covenent with</hi> Jacob, <hi>with</hi> Jsaac, <hi>and with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and remember the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis evident <hi>God gives Grace and Favour to the humble.</hi> And in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> when God pronounceth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet thus he saith to the humble: <hi>If that Nation against whom I have pronounced turne from their evill, then will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evill that I thought to do unto them,</hi> Jeremy 18.8. Do you expect examples to confirme this Doctrine? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them marshalld in a full body, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. verse 27.19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6.7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27.28. First in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb facs="tcp:160342:6"/>of <hi>Ahab,</hi> for after he had rent his cloathes, and fasted, and lay in Sack cloath &amp;c. <hi>Elijah</hi> denouncing judgements, God grants a reprieve of those judgements. <hi>Seest thou</hi> (saith God) <hi>how</hi> Ahab <hi>humbleth himselfe, &amp;c. I will not bring the evill in his days, but in his sons days will I bring it,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27.29. Next in <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> for, when <hi>Shemajah</hi> had told him and his two Princes, that God had left him in the hand of <hi>Shishak</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> in the 7 verse, when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the Lord said, <hi>I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some Deliverance, and my wrath shall not bee powered out upon</hi> Jerusalem <hi>by the hand of</hi> Shishak. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6.7. In <hi>Manasses,</hi> he humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, by the innocent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of prayer and supplication he knocks off the Fetters of his Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; makes a Gaole delivery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Almighty God signing his <hi>Dimittis,</hi> and bringing him againe to his Kingdome. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.13. Lastly, of <hi>Josiah</hi> thus speakes God, <hi>Because thy heart was tender and thou didst humble thy selfe before thy God, when thou heardst his words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and didst rend thy cloathes, and weepe before me, I have even heard thee also saith the Lord. Behold I will gather thee to thy fathers and to thy grave in peace,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27.28.</p>
            <p>Next a third reason was, because Humiliation disposeth the Soule with good previous dispositions for mercy, puts it in a posture and capacity to receive the loving kindnesse of the Lord, and truly this is manifest by a certaine place of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> in his 66 <hi>chap. the first and second ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> God shews he is not delighted in magnificent structures, against the Jewes, that gloryed in the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, like their Successours that boasted they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father: God points them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Temple, the Temple of the Holy Ghost in an humble heart. For thus saith God: <hi>Where is the House that you
<pb facs="tcp:160342:6"/>build unto mee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But to this man will looke, even to him that is poore and of a contrite spirit</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Esa.</hi> 66.1, 2. God hath these two notable Mansion houses, the highest Heavens, and the humblest heart to dwell in; humility is the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of his Excellency; God intends good things for them that are humble. In the 8 of <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. Hee tells the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> he <hi>humbled them to doe them good in the latter end.</hi> And so our Saviour having exhorted his servants to bee lowly, at the last concludes <hi>they shall find rest unto their soules, Mat.</hi> 11.28. Truly the meek are filled with good things, when the rich and proude in opinion are sent empty away. For God setteth himself as in battaile array <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, for so the word signifies, a military terme, against the proud, but gives grace to the humble. If wee would then that God should meet us in a way of mercy, prepare to meet him in poverty and sincerity of spirit.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the necessity. Now for the nature of this humbling which consists in 5 principall thing<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¶</desc>
               </gap> A godly scrutiny or search after sin, a Hue and Cry. 2 Godly shame for sin. 3. Godly sorrow. 4 Confession of heart and mouth. 5 A judging of our selves. I will passe them over cursorily.</p>
            <p>For the first duty assure your selves God expects it from you, and he finds fault with the absence of it. Looke into the 8 of <hi>Jere.</hi> the 6. Where God imputeth their horrible impenitency in a great measure to their carelesse examining themselves, for there no man saith what evill have I done? Sure the very Heathen will rise up in judgement against such for so <hi>Phocyllides,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; that is, every day he would call himself to account, what good duties hee omitted, what evill deeds hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Good God! how generally we come short of this? O that we did keepe Catalogues of our darling sins in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb facs="tcp:160342:7"/>and spread them before us when wee goe to prayer to pray against them and humble our soules: as godly Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> was daily wont to doe. There are many idle Diurnalls fly abroad, but this would bee the best Diurnall of all and most profitable. O if we did but take notice of the speciall passages of sinnes since but the last Fast, to be humbled for them. <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. <hi>Commune with your owne selves,</hi> and <hi>Paul, examine your selves if you bee in the faith.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Next is godly shame. Upon strict search ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the plague of our hearts, let our faces gather blackenesse and bee covered with confusion. Take unto our selves the good words of <hi>Ezra</hi> cap. 9.6. <hi>O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my God: for our Iniquities are increased over our heads, and our trespasse is growne up into the Heavens.</hi> With the Publican dare not to lift up our eyes to Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 18 ver. 13.</p>
